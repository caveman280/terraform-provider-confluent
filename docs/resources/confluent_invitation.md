# confluent_invitation Resource

[![Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-Preview-%2300afba)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

-> **Note:** `confluent_invitation` resource is available in **Preview** for early adopters. Preview features are introduced to gather customer feedback. This feature should be used only for evaluation and non-production testing purposes or to provide feedback to Confluent, particularly as it becomes more widely available in follow-on editions.  
**Preview** features are intended for evaluation use in development and testing environments only, and not for production use. The warranty, SLA, and Support Services provisions of your agreement with Confluent do not apply to Preview features. Preview features are considered to be a Proof of Concept as defined in the Confluent Cloud Terms of Service. Confluent may discontinue providing preview releases of the Preview features at any time in Confluentâ€™s sole discretion.

`confluent_invitation` provides an invitation resource that enables creating, reading, and deleting invitation on Confluent Cloud.

-> **Note:** It is recommended to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental invitation deletion. This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the invitation, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes. Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).
## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "confluent_invitation" "main" {
    email = ""
}

resource "confluent_invitation" "main2" {
    email = ""
    auth_type = "AUTH_TYPE_LOCAL"
}
